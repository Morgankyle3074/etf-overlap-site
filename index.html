            Investors often combine ETFs by fund label (growth, dividend, broad market) and assume
            diversification improves automatically. But ETFs frequently share many of the same
            underlying holdings—especially cap-weighted funds—creating hidden duplication of exposure.

              This ranking highlights which ETF pairs create the greatest redundancy. The largest overlap
              appears between SPY and VOO (about ~65%), suggesting they behave as near substitutes even
              though they are different funds. Secondary pairs (QQQ vs VOO, QQQ vs SPY) remain material.

              The heatmap shows overlap intensity across ETFs. Darker cells mean higher economic
              duplication (not just shared tickers, but shared weights). It makes “hidden concentration”
              visible—adding more ETFs can increase complexity without adding meaningful diversification.

            heavier concentration in leading names (growth-heavy structure), while SCHD appears more
            distributed. SPY and VOO are broad but still inherit cap-weighting skewness.

          <h3>Project Thought Process</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
          ETFs are diversified individually, but when you combine multiple ETFs, diversification must be
          evaluated at the holdings level. This project reframes each ETF as a weighted basket of
          securities and measures overlap using weight-adjusted intersection to capture true economic
          redundancy.
        </p>

        <p>
          The results show overlap is structurally embedded in cap-weighted index construction. Some
          combinations (especially SPY + VOO) provide limited incremental diversification, while still
          increasing portfolio complexity. Weighting methodology influences risk: concentrated top
          weights can dominate portfolio behavior even if total holding count is high.
        </p>

          <strong>Investor takeaway:</strong>
          Don’t assume “more ETFs = more diversification.” Evaluate overlap and concentration explicitly,
          especially in markets dominated by a small set of large-cap names.
