      <p>
        Investors frequently construct portfolios by combining ETFs based on fund labels, themes, or classifications.
        While ETFs are diversified individually, portfolios composed of multiple ETFs may not generate additive
        diversification benefits. Overlapping holdings can create duplicated economic exposure, resulting in hidden
        concentration risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        This structural redundancy is particularly relevant in markets characterized by elevated capitalization
        concentration, where a relatively small subset of securities dominate index weighting. As ETFs increasingly
        inherit these weighting structures, portfolios that appear diversified at the fund level may exhibit
        significant concentration at the holdings level.

      <h2>Project Thought Process</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Traditional diversification analysis often evaluates portfolios at the fund level.
        This project reframes ETFs as weighted baskets of securities, enabling holdings-level
        evaluation of economic exposure duplication.
      </p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Measure diversification quality beyond ETF count.</li>
        <li><strong>Method:</strong> Weight-adjusted overlap analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Lens:</strong> Overlap + Concentration Metrics (HHI, Effective Holdings).</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Identify structural portfolio redundancy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The findings demonstrate that diversification assumptions based solely on fund variety may be misleading.
        Structural weighting and overlap dynamics materially influence portfolio concentration and risk exposure.

        <div class="insight">
          <h4>Data &amp; Analytics Framework</h4>
          <p>
            The analysis integrates Python, SQL, and Tableau to evaluate ETF structure at the holdings level.
            Allocation weights were normalized and matched across funds to enable precise overlap measurement
            and concentration assessment.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
          <h4>Methodology</h4>
          <p>
            Overlap was measured using weight-adjusted intersections rather than holding counts.
            This approach captures economic exposure duplication, distinguishing between nominal overlap
            and economically dominant overlap.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
          <h4>Concentration Metrics</h4>
          <p>
            Diversification quality was evaluated using Effective Holdings and HHI metrics.
            These measures reveal structural weighting effects that traditional holding counts
            fail to capture.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
          <h4>Key Findings</h4>
          <p>
            Results show that ETF overlap is structurally embedded, with certain fund pairings
            functioning as near economic substitutes. Portfolio diversification assumptions
            therefore require holdings-level validation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="insight">
          <h4>Implications for Investors</h4>
          <p>
            Fund-level diversification may conceal exposure redundancy. Investors should evaluate
            allocation structure, weighting effects, and overlap dynamics to avoid unintended
            concentration risk.
          </p>
        </div>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Investor Takeaway:</strong>
        Diversification must be evaluated at the holdings level, not inferred from ETF labels.
