    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Investors frequently construct portfolios by combining ETFs based on fund labels, themes, or classifications.
        While ETFs are diversified individually, portfolios composed of multiple ETFs may not generate additive
        diversification benefits. Overlapping holdings can create duplicated economic exposure, resulting in hidden
        concentration risk.
      </p>

      <p>
        This structural redundancy is particularly relevant in markets characterized by elevated capitalization
        concentration, where a relatively small subset of securities dominate index weighting. As ETFs increasingly
        inherit these weighting structures, portfolios that appear diversified at the fund level may exhibit
        significant concentration at the holdings level.

      <h2>Project Thought Process</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Traditional diversification analysis often evaluates portfolios at the fund level.
        This project reframes ETFs as weighted baskets of securities, enabling holdings-level
        evaluation of economic exposure duplication.
      </p>

      <ul class="bullets">
        <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Measure diversification quality beyond ETF count.</li>
        <li><strong>Method:</strong> Weight-adjusted overlap analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Lens:</strong> Overlap + Concentration Metrics (HHI, Effective Holdings).</li>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> Identify structural portfolio redundancy.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The findings demonstrate that diversification assumptions based solely on fund variety may be misleading.
        Structural weighting and overlap dynamics materially influence portfolio concentration and risk exposure.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Investor Takeaway:</strong>
        Diversification must be evaluated at the holdings level, not inferred from ETF labels.
